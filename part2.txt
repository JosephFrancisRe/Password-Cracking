                             PART 2 - Dictionary Attack over a Simple Web Application

                                          Part 2 Description of Attack

The purpose of this part of the project is quite similar to Part 1. The major difference is rather than running
the dictionary attack on my local machine using either the computing power of my local CPU or GPU, I must utilize
the POST request functionality innate to HTML. Such an HTML form submission will be substantially slower.

Nonetheless, the steps to conduct the attack are more or less identical. In fact, I will use the same word list as
I used in Part 1.

                                           --------------------------

                   Ways the web app developer could prevent or mitigate such an attack

1) Lockout IP addresses or accounts that are making a rapid succession of login attempts
2) Limit the number of incorrect password attempts per username and IP address on an hourly basis
3) Require a captcha after a predetermined number of unsuccessful login attempts

                                           --------------------------

                                            Steps to Complete Part 2

1) Change your directory in the command line to the base folder
2) Type into the command line the following prompt: python3 webapp.py
3) Open another command line terminal and change its directory to the base folder.
4) Type into the second command line the following prompt: python3 pwcrack_online.py
